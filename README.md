# Unofficial S&Box Wikipedia
## Motivation
The current state of the S&Box wiki is alright. However, to ensure that high-quality information is maintained and continuously available, it is important to continually monitor and update the contents of the wiki.
Which is not possible, as their Wiki-Engine is limited.

I do not mean to be any kind of competition, I just wish to create an intuitive and smooth learn-experience.
